## What is GOTM?

GOTM - the **G**eneral **O**cean **T**urbulence **M**odel is an ambitious name for a one-dimensional water column model for marine and limnological applications. It is coupled to a choice of traditional as well as state-of-the-art parameterisations for vertical turbulent mixing. The package consists of the FORTRAN source code, a number of idealised and realistic test cases, and a scientific documentation, all published under the GNU public license.

A comprehensive description including compilation instructions are given at the official [GOTM homepage](http://www.gotm.net/portfolio/software).
