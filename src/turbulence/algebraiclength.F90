! !ROUTINE: Some algebraic length-scale relations \label{sec:algebraiclength}
!
! !INTERFACE:
   subroutine algebraiclength(method,nlev,z0b,z0s,depth,h,NN)
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
! This subroutine computes the vertical profile of the turbulent
! scale $l$ from different types of analytical expressions. These
! range from simple geometrical forms to more complicated expressions
! taking into account the effects of stratification and shear. The
! users can select their method in the input file {\tt gotmturb.nml}.
! For convenience, we define here $d_b$ and $d_s$ as the distance
! from the bottom and the surface, respectively. The water
! depth is then given by $H=d_b+d_s$, and $z_0^b$ and
! $z_0^s$ are the repective roughness lengths. With these
! abbreviations, the expressions implemented in GOTM are as follows.
! \begin{enumerate}
!  \item The parabolic profile is defined according to
!    \begin{equation}
!      l=\kappa \frac{(d_s+z_0^s) (d_b+z_0^b)}
!                    {d_s+d_b+z_0^b+z_0^s}
!    \comma
!    \end{equation}
!    where it should be noted that only for large water depth
!    this equation converges to $\kappa(z+z_0)$ near the bottom
!   or near the surface.
!  \item The triangular profile is defined according to
!    \begin{equation}
!       l = \kappa \, \min(d_s+z_0^s,d_b+z_0^b)
!    \comma
!    \end{equation}
!    which converges always to $\kappa(z+z_0)$ near the bottom
!   or near the surface.
!  \item A distorted parabola can be constructed by
!     using a slightly modified form of the equation
!     used by \cite{XingDavies95},
!     \begin{equation}
!        l = \kappa \frac{(d_s+z_0^s)(d_b^\text{Xing}+z_0^b)}
!                      {d_s+d_b^\text{Xing}+z_0^s+z_0^b}
!        \comma
!        d_b^\text{Xing} =
!        d_b \exp{\left(-\beta \frac{d_b}{H} \right)}
!    \comma
!    \end{equation}
!    where it should be noted that only for large water depth
!    this equation converges to $\kappa(z+z_0)$ near the bottom
!   or near the surface. The constant $\beta$ is a form parameter
!   determining the distortion of the profile. Currently we use
!   $\beta = 2$ in GOTM.
!  \item A distorted parabola can be constructed by
!     using a slightly modified form of the equation
!     used by \cite{RobertOuellet87},
!    \begin{equation}
!       l = \kappa (d_b+z_0^b)
!           \sqrt{1-\frac{d_b-z_0^s}{H}}
!    \comma
!   \end{equation}
!    where it should be noted that only for large water depth
!    this equation converges to $\kappa(z+z_0)$ near the bottom.
!    Near the surface, the slope of $l$ is always different from
!    the law of the wall, a fact that becomes important when model
!    solutions for the case of breaking waves are computed, see
!    \sect{sec:analyse}.
!  \item Also the famous formula of \cite{Blackadar62} is based on
!     a parabolic shape, extended by an extra length--scale $l_a$.
!    Using the form of \cite{Luytenetal96}, the algebraic relation
!    is expressed by
!     \begin{equation}
!        l = \left( \frac{1}{\kappa (d_s+z_0^s)}
!                  +\frac{1}{\kappa (d_b+z_0^b)}
!                  +\dfrac{1}{l_a} \right)
!    \comma
!     \end{equation}
!    where
!   \begin{equation}
!        l_a = \gamma_0 \frac{\int_{-H}^\eta k^\frac{1}{2} z dz}
!                            {\int_{-H}^\eta k^\frac{1}{2} dz}
! \end{equation}
!    is the natural kinetic energy scale resulting from the
!    first moment of the rms turbulent velocity. The constant
!    $\gamma_0$ usually takes the value $\gamma_0 = 0.2$.
!    It should be noted that this expression for $l$
!    converges to $\kappa(z+z_0)$ at the surface and the bottom
!    only for large water depth, and when $l_a$ plays only a
!    minor role.
!  \item The so--called ISPRAMIX method to compute the length--scale
!   is described in detail in \sect{sec:ispramix}.
! \end{enumerate}
! After the length--scale has been computed, it is optionally
! limited by the method suggested by \cite{Galperinetal88}. This
! option can be activated in {\tt gotmturb.nml} by setting
! {\tt length\_lim = .true.} The rate of dissipation is computed
! according to \eq{epsilon}.
